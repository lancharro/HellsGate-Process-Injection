### Update  ###
Please note:
* We are not claiming that this is ground-breaking as many people have been using this kind of technique for many years;
* We are not claiming that this is the perfect and most optimised way to archive the objective. This is just one example on how to implementation the technique;
* Judging the idea/technique/project/research solely on the name is petty to say the least and definitively childish; and
* Any recommendation and/or ideas will always be welcome, just open an issue in this repository.
